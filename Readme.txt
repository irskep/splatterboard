 = Introduction =
 ================

Splatterboard is a painting program. Its main goals:
 * Provide interesting painting tools that engage people
 * Make it easy to write new tools
 * Get out of the way

So far, it mostly achieves those goals. There are a few bugs, but the basic structure is there, and it will be improved as issues are pointed out.

 ======================
 = About the Stickers =
 ======================

Almost all of the stickers were taken directly from www.pdclipart.com, with the few exceptions drawn by Steve Johnson. The current stickers set is incomplete and doesn't really do what a good stickers set should do. In the future, stickers should have the following attributes:
 * Augment creativity rather than inhibit it
 * If very specific, be part of a larger set of stickers that go together
 * Public domain
For example, if one were to make a sticker of a soda can, the inside should be completely white and as sparse as possible to allow the user to draw the label as desired. It should also probably be part of a larger set of food stickers.

Sticker wish list:
 * Mad scientist laboratory: pipes, beakers, wires, science-y things
 * Building kit: Basic building shapes that can be combined to make buildings or cityscapes
 * Spaceship kit: Thrusters, lasers, cockpits, bodies
 * Face kit: Think Mr. Pototo Head.
 * Trees, rocks, etc

 * Images of non-Splatterboard-sized proportions do not load elegantly
